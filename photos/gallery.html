			Thanks for visiting my media gallery. It is a work in progress. I'm trying to decide how to present some much older weather/nature pictures I have but still 
			need to figure that out. The reason I created this was two-fold: One, I'm trying to use social media much less; Two, I'm self-concious about whether something 
			would 'fit-in' on social-media. So here, I don't really have to worry about that.

According to the Mesoanalysis, for that evening, CAPE was around 3000 J/kg, but it was a skinny-CAPE profile, highlighted by low LI's. But DCAPE's were well over 1000 J/kg. While weak vertical accelerations probably prevented this nice cell from producing thunder, portions of sinking parcels with the rain likely generated the exceptional cool breeze (the DCAPE). The rain stayed to our South while streams of sunlight stayed mostly visible here. I was trying to capture some general time-lapse imagery, hoping to get some rain-shafts in-shot when I noticed a small updraft becoming striated, which made me think, rotation! I quickly turned all my focus on this updraft. This is the result. Really cool. Of note, this is about a 10-minute time-lapse, so the overall vorticity shown by this updraft is likely pretty low. But you can clearly see that this updraft was a prominent low-pressure perturbation, being the focus of the inflow. Then you can tell that the bouyant updraft twisted that inflow into the vertical. I wished I had noticed that updraft sooner, but oh well.",
