desc = ["02/06/2019 - Cloudbreaks plus sunrise equals goodness.",
        "04/29/2019 - Asperitas Time-Lapse (1hr); increased the contrast/decreased brightness to allow the wavy blanket motion to show better. I've been hoping to get a good Asperitas time-lapse for a while. This one was a blessing.",
        "05/12/2019 - Post-Frontal Rainbow",
        "05/25/2019 - Developing Convection. Saw this as it started as a robust updraft cumuliform base. As it tracked ENE over Stokes County, more and more parcels started to explode, leading to a pleasantly surprising convection time-lapse. The storm fizzled after it passed over the Hanging Rock area.",
        "05/25/2019 - Mature Thunderstorm over SW VA (I believe Henry Co.), with echo-tops punching 50kft. For a time (I believe it was this cell), it hinted at some supercell structure as it traversed Patrick County, (between 23z and 0z had signs of an RFD, a v-notch, and inflow notch).",
        "05/29/2019 - Great buoyancy displayed here. Time-lapse of around 50 minutes of clips",
        "08/07/2019 - Post-maturation to decay of a cell in southern tier of county",
        "10/01/2019 - Slow-moving cell in Patrick County, VA; Strong but skinny-CAPE; deep-layer moderate-shear, but weakly moderate effective-shear. Check out the linear anvil off-shoot, resultant of the 45+ kt UL winds.",
        "10/01/2019 - Setting Waxing Crescent. 0.5s exposure. Clouds from earlier showers had dissapated leaving clear skies, with a young moon chasing the sun.",
        "10/01/2019 - Setting Waxing Crescent. 8sec exposure. Extra time caught more glow from the sliver and the earthshine. Tree-tops were a nice touch.",
        "Oct 2019 - Very vibrant sunset",
        "11/12/2019 - Post-Frontal Passage. A strong cold-front moved through this day. Camera is generally pointed south/southeast. Good display of showing winds changing with height. Here, they are 'backing' with height, implying the definite Cold-Air Advection. I was hoping to catch some KH clouds, and I think at times they did but were very short-lived or not robust enough to catch on camera"]
