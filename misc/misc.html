	Alphabet Numerics</button>
	<div id="scriptALPHA" style="display:none;"><br>
		An exercise in utilizing string indices. This was one of the first scripts I practiced with in Python: the concept that a declared 
		string can be treated just like an array can. Each character in the string is assigned an array index (starting at index 0). So I 
		simply created a single string of the alphabet. It asks for a number, then reports the letter that corresponds to the entry.
<br><pre class="box"># The alphabet string; The _ takes up index 0, so 1 corresponds to 'a,' while 26 corresponds to 'z'
abc = "_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

# Ask the user to input a number...
entry = int(input("ENTER A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 and 26, AND WE'LL SHOW YOU WHICH LETTER IT CORRESPONDS WITH: "))

# Outputs the correct number
print("The Letter in position #", entry, " is '", abc[entry].upper(), "'")

		I made this little console game. The basics are very simple. I 
		added some more custom functions to it, adding more features including an on-screen game-end notification, sounds, difficulties, 
		and menus. I'm considering using this as a base for a javascript/css project.

		a team (+ means they are projected to lose; minus indicates projected victory). So this basic script takes 
		in entry of the home and away teams, the over/under, and the victory margin (w/respect to the home team). It then 
		calculates/outputs the approximate final score and indicates the projected winner. It is normal to get x.5s for answers. This is 
		exactly due to it cannot be the final score, which would preventstie situations.

	<div id="scriptPENNRAP" style="display:none;"><br>
	Similarly to the SPC, Penn St. archives basic hourly RAP data. The advantage is that the output is delivered in their fabled 4-Panel 
	layout. There aren't countless variables it gives to look at, but it is excellent to analyze the synoptic situation of the atmosphere. 
	It also eliminates the need of overlays. So instead of creating a viewer, when the files are saved, they have their own unique filename.
	Viewing is simply done in your favorite slideshow viewer (Windows has a great one; cycling through the images with just arrow keys). 
	The idea with this is that it enables you to quickly assess the synoptic situation of a past event or pre-cursor to one. *NOTE: Be sure

<span style="color: #6aa84f; font-size: large;"><b><u>CSS Star Field Generator</u></b></span> - I wrote this in Python for use in an HTML/CSS/Javascript project I was working on. It produces a random star field. You can modify their quantities sizes and spatial limits. I hope it helps you out. Read the instructions and look over/adjust the predefined variables.
<pre style="background-color: #17202a; border: 1px dashed #999999; color: black; font-family: &quot;andale mono&quot; , &quot;lucida console&quot; , &quot;monaco&quot; , &quot;fixed&quot; , monospace; font-size: 12px; height: 200px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"><code style="color: #aed6f1; font-weight: bold; word-wrap: normal;">import random

# CSS STAR-FIELD GENERATOR
# Code by Kyle Gentry (online handle: ksgwxfan)
# Feel free to implement in a project, modify, and/or improve as needed
# I'd appreciate credit (in your code or source) if it is some use to you in your project

# WHAT IT DOES: Outputs code for a star-field for use in CSS projects by generating x-number of
# radial gradients (the stars)
# INSTRUCTIONS: Tweak the predefined variables for your liking; Copy/paste the code into your style sheet

# CONSTANTS FOR THE FIELD
line_start = "radial-gradient(circle at "   # START each line with this
line_end = "), /*Star*/"                   # END each line with this

# PRE-DEFINED VARIABLES
celestials = 70        # Total number of stars in the starfield
min_opa = .35           # Minimum Opacity (0 &lt;= value &lt;= 1)
max_opa = .65           # Maximum Opacity (0 &lt;= value &lt;= 1)
minrg = 200             # Will determine the minimum red and green values for each star
max_star_size = 0.25     # Largest Star Size (in percent)
max_star_glow = 1.5       # Widest Glow Expanse (in percent)
max_x = 100             # Maximum X Position (in percent)
max_y = 86              # Maximum Y Position (in percent)

for every_star in range(0,celestials+1):
    # Generate random variables for each star
    opacity = str(round(random.triangular(min_opa,max_opa),2))                       # Determine Star Brightness
    size = str(round(random.triangular(0.01,max_star_size),2))                 # SIZE
    glow = str(round(random.triangular(max_star_size,max_star_glow),2))     # GLOW
    rgcolor = str(round(random.randint(minrg,255+1),2))                     # Red-Green Brightness
    xpos = str(round(random.randint(0,max_x+1),2))                          # X Position
    ypos = str(round(random.randint(0,max_y+1),2))                          # Y Position
    
    print(line_start + xpos + "% " + ypos + "%, rgba(" + rgcolor + "," + rgcolor + ",255," + opacity + ") " + size + "%, " \
          + "rgba(255,255,255,0) " + glow + "%" + line_end)</code></pre>
