			Alphabet Numerics</button>
			<div id="scriptALPHA" style="display:none;text-align:justify;"><br>
				An exercise in utilizing string indices. This was one of the first scripts I practiced with in Python: the concept that a declared 
				string can be treated just like an array can. Each character in the string is assigned an array index (starting at index 0). So I 
				simply created a single string of the alphabet. It asks for a number, then reports the letter that corresponds to the entry.
				<br><pre class="box"># The alphabet string; The _ takes up index 0, so 1 corresponds to 'a,' while 26 corresponds to 'z'
abc = "_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

# Ask the user to input a number...
entry = int(input("ENTER A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 and 26, AND WE'LL SHOW YOU WHICH LETTER IT CORRESPONDS WITH: "))

# Outputs the correct number
print("The Letter in position #", entry, " is '", abc[entry].upper(), "'")

				I made this little console game. The basics are very simple. I 
				added some more custom functions to it, adding more features including an on-screen game-end notification, sounds, difficulties, 
				and menus. I'm considering using this as a base for a javascript/css project.

			Sports Score Projections via Vegas Lines</button>
			<div id="scriptOVERUNDER" style="display:none;text-align:justify;"><br>
				Experts release sports-betting lines for games and give 
				1) a projected accumulated total of points between the teams (the "over/under"), and 2) a projected margin of victory relative to 
				a team (+ means they are projected to lose; minus indicates projected victory). So this basic script takes 
				in entry of the home and away teams, the over/under, and the victory margin (w/respect to the home team). It then 
				calculates/outputs the approximate final score and indicates the projected winner. It is normal to get x.5s for answers. This is exactly due to it cannot be the final score, which would prevent ties.
				<br><pre class="box"># "What's the Over and Under?"

margin = float(input("What is the margin (w/respect to the home team)?: "))     # This is the +/- number

			PSU e-Wall RAP Downloader</button>
			<div id="scriptPENNRAP" style="display:none;text-align:justify;"><br>
				Similarly to the SPC, Penn St. archives basic hourly RAP data. The advantage is that the output is delivered in their fabled 4-Panel 
				layout. There aren't countless variables it gives to look at, but it is excellent to analyze the synoptic situation of the atmosphere. 
				It also eliminates the need of overlays. So instead of creating a viewer, when the files are saved, they have their own unique filename.
				Viewing is simply done in your favorite slideshow viewer (Windows has a great one; cycling through the images with just arrow keys). 
				The idea with this is that it enables you to quickly assess the synoptic situation of a past event or pre-cursor to one. *NOTE: Be sure 
				to put this script in its own folder
