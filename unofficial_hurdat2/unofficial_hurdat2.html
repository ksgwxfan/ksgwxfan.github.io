			<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:yellow;">* Updated thru 27 NOV 2020.</span> -- This page will 'reset' upon issuance of the annual release of HURDAT2 out of deference to the complete, expertly analyzed data.</p>

			<p>* Information presented here has been gathered from preliminary current-season 'best-track' data from <a href="https://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/btk/">https://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/btk/</a>. Landfall data is not natively marked in the best-track data. To assist with that, the advisory archives (<a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2020/">https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2020/</a>) were used to isolate landfall records and, along with QGIS, were used to assist in interpolating other likely landfalls and their latitude/longitude positioning, and to approximate timing.</p>
			
			<p>In general, potential landfalls over small islands were not considered due to the highly-variable nature with any change in the preliminary data and general lack of accuracy stemming from coordinate data being rounded to the nearest 10th of a degree.</p>
			
			<p>Due to lack of information, 'null' data (using -999) was used for TS, TS50kt, and HU wind extents, as applicable, for manually-input landfalls</p>

			<p>Precision was not the aim of including landfall markers (especially the interpolated ones) but were included to provide homogeneity and temporary inclusion with the <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html">official HURDAT2 record</a>. In general, the official record is updated during the Spring of each year, prior to the start of Hurricane Season.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>My primary purpose for this is for use in an updated (and currently unreleased) version of my hurdat2parser program (python) I'm working on. I believe there are other hurdat2 parsing programs out there. Feel free to use this output in any way you'd like. My only request of it is that you strive to avoid representing it as NOAA data.</p>
			<p>* Below you'll find some info for the season through the date listed. As a courtesy, I included some ranking as well.</p>
