			<p style="color:pink;text-align: center;">* This page is <u>NOT</u> endorsed nor supported by NOAA or its subsidiaries, including the National Hurricane Center. *</p>

			<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:yellow;">* Updated thru 27 NOV 2020.</span><br />-- Upon issuance of the official HURDAT2 update (generally in proximity to the start of Hurricane Season), this site will be cleared to prepare for the upcoming season.</p>

			<p>* Information presented here is retrieved from current-season 'best-track' (<a href="https://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/btk/">https://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/btk/</a>) data. Because landfall-data are not recorded in the best-track data, they are compiled using the advisory archive (<a href="https://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/adv">https://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/adv</a>). GIS software has also been used at times to estimate landfall locale and timing.</p>
			
			<p>In the future, potential landfalls over small islands will not be considered due to the highly-variable nature with any change in the preliminary data and general lack of accuracy stemming from coordinate data being rounded to the nearest 10th of a degree.</p>
			
			<p>Wind-extent information is currently not included. As such, 'null' space-fillers (-999) are used where applicable.</p>

			<p>Precision is not the aim of landfall inclusion (especially the interpolated ones) but were pursued to provide homogeneity and temporary inclusion with the <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat">official HURDAT2 record</a>. The official record is updated during the Spring of each year, prior to the start of Hurricane Season.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Feel free to use this output in any way you'd like. My only request of it is that if used publicly, <u>you must provide the disclaimer that the data, though mostly retrieved from NOAA, is not NOAA-official, provided, nor generated/u>. My primary purpose for this is for use in my <a href="https://github.com/ksgwxfan/hurdat2parser">hurdat2parser</a> program by concatenating it with the official data. One can then compare the current-season to previous years using a supplied function that ranks partial seasons.</p>
			<p>* Below you'll find some info for the season through the date listed. As a courtesy, I included some ranking as well.</p>
