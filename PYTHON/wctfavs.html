		<div class="information">
			<p>WCTFAVS files work exclusively in <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/wct/">NOAA's Weather Climate Toolkit</a> (WCT). Files of the <kbd>.wctfav</kbd> extension are tab-delimited text files where each line represents a product. The first column is the html link to the file of interest, the second column is a human-readable description of the file. These files can be loaded using the favorites tab in the Data Selector of WCT. Though use is typically to store your favorite or most-frequently accessed data, I engineered these files with Python, specifically for use with the favorites feature. They specifically access the most recent Level-III radar data.</p>
			<p>WCT makes accessing Level-II data very simple, but L3 data is a little more difficult, although MUCH easier than before. You can now access the data via a menu process, but if you find that to get cumbersome, these files may help you. Especially if you want to use WCT in near-real time.</p>
			<p>* For convenience, <kbd>mrms_products.wctfavs</kbd> was also included, it linking the most-recent MRMS Products</p>

			What makes the use of these files possible is that on the NWS servers, they include a file: <kbd>sn.last</kbd>, which will always hold the newest data for a given product. So each WCTFAV file can pull up the most recent data for a given product. TDWR Sites Files are grouped together by State.
