	WCTFAVS files work exclusively in <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/wct/" target="_blank">NOAA's Weather Climate Toolkit</a> (WCT). WCTFAVS is a type of file 
	extension for a basic-formatted text file, specific to WCT. They're designed so the user can store their favorite products for quick 
	access. Futhermore, using WCT for real-time Level-3 Radar data is generally not recommended and can be very frustrating to work with. 
	The purpose of me making these files was to make accessing the most-recent level 3 data (grouped per parent radar site). This way you 
	open 	the file you want and all of the links to the most-recent radar data for that specific site is all in one list.<p>

	The file contains ftp-links to the real-time updated <a href="https://www.weather.gov/tg/" target="_blank">NWS Telecommunication 
	Gateway</a>. Their servers keep the 200+ most-recent files for each individual radar product. That server holds approximately 3 
	Million+ recent radar files! Luckily, when they update, it also updates a file whose name doesn't change: "sn.last," which will always 
	hold the newest data for a given product. So each WCTFAV file can pull up the most recent data for a given product.<p>

	<div class="CAPTION">An example of what the inside of the radar WCTFAV files looks like</div><p>
	In addition, to cut-down on quantity of files, I included the airport TDWR Radar data along with a nearby WSR-88d location.<p>
	I'm not sure if these files will be of service to you, but it sure did to me as a WCT fan. Be sure to read the readme for instructions 
	on how to use. In the future (or at your request) I may upload the python code I used to generate all of those files (I didn't do it 
	manually by any means!).<p>

	It did take me a while and, who knows: Maybe it wouldn't have taken me as long to do it manually, but I know I would have got bored very 
	fast doing that and wouldn't have completed the project. Thanks for reading!
