	The <a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/mesoanalysis/new/viewsector.php?sector=19" target="_blank">SPC Mesoanalysis</a> is one of my 
	favorite tools to use when looking getting a glimpse of conditions out there. It is based on the RAP model which is updated hourly. 
	They publish over 140 products during each hour. The page shows the 'zero-hour' forecast. It does allow you to look at previous imagery 
	but this is quite limited. My intent on use of this script is archival/research purposes. Regionally they only archive 3 days worth of 
	data but limit your view to 2 or 3 images, this script gives ease of access to the archive. If there is a strong storm system that 
	comes through, afterward, you can run this tool, indicate how long of a back up you want to do, pick the products you want, and 
	download them. Being able to look at a regional (think mesoscale) view allows some features to stand out.<p>

	The program then creates a file directory structure that archives the images, first by region, then by product, then by date. The 
	advantage of this is that you can study the images without the included html files and you'd still be able to cycle through them in 
	order. This script is extremely advantageous because it utilizes the <a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/hanis/" target="_blank">HAniS 
	module</a> (included with download). My script simultaneously produces an html file (which will be used for viewing), control file 
	(which tells the script how you want it to look and which options to include), and a filenames file that the HAniS program reads so 
	it knows what images to display (and corresponding overlays) according to the time. This took quite a while as I had little experience 
	with HAniS. Then, if you look at the python code, you'll also notice it is nearly 300 lines long. I also took a long break from working 
	with it when I first got it functional. The thing is if you miss one little detail in creating the config and filenames (get 
	format wrong), it can throw the whole operation off. So I was really happy when I got it to work.<p>
	In the code I included error controls which should prevent 'malfunction' during use. I wasn't initially sure how to get some things to 
	work, so searching the web was trusty in that. I tried to include links to all my sources; generally they're found at the start of each 
	function.<p>
	Included in the bundle is a small script called 'http_server.py.' This likely will be needed for the web browser to display your file 
	properly since we're operating locally. Follow the on-screen instructions. You'll notice if you do need it, that you won't be 
	directly opening the created html file. P.S. - You'll want to unzip the file's contents into their own folder. See the included readme 
	for terms of use.Contact me if you have any questions!<p>
	* NOTE: You'll likely run into missing images of the most-recent hour if your request is in the early part of an hour. This is because 
	it takes time to generate each model run. The filename scheme that I used is anticipatory of what the filenames will be. So if you 
	encounter some blank images, understand it generally has to do with the time you ran the script and not an error in the program. I'm 
	considering options on how to handle that.<p>
	* NOTE 2: Some images aren't very overlay friendly. This is due to that archived images have a thatched fill rather than a solid fill. 
	Play around with which products work the best with one another. Another option is to use the CONUS sector (s19). Things may be able to 
	be better-seen on that, especially synoptic features.<p>
	* NOTE 3: The <a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/ma_archive/index2.html" target="_blank">SPC does archive the CONUS sector with 
	solid-fill variables</a>. I've been thinking about releasing a similar script with that so you can work with older events. Stay tuned!
